#####To view first 5 rows of the dataset
SPOOL C:\Users\SHRAVANI\Documents\result_table.txt
select * from Sales where rownum <=5;

###To check datatypes
DESC Sales;
### Since date is string we have to convert it into data-type format

####Extract the month of order
SELECT ORDER_ID,
       ORDER_DATE,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(ORDER_DATE, 'DD/MM/YYYY')) AS ORDER_MONTH,
       PRODUCT_ID,
       PRODUCT_NAME,
       AMOUNT
FROM Sales where rownum<=5;


##### Group by year and month
####Calculate  the sum of amount
####Count distinct order ID

###Since order date is stored into varchar format we need to convert the date into correct format
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(order_date, 'DD/MM/YYYY')) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(order_date, 'DD/MM/YYYY')) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume

    REGEXP_LIKE(order_date, '^\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}$') 
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(order_date, 'DD/MM/YYYY')),

EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year

Pulls the year part from the order_date column.

For example, if order_date is 2021-08-11, this will return 2021.

EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month

Pulls the month part from the order_date.

For example, from 2021-08-11, it returns 8.

SUM(amount) AS total_revenue

Adds up the amount column for each month.

This gives the total revenue generated in each month.

COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume

Counts the number of unique order IDs in each month.

This gives the total number of orders placed (volume).
