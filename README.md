The sql query is designed to perform a sales trend analysis on the online sales data. We use extract function to get the year and month from order_date column, by which we group sales data into monthly interval to understand peak sales months. Sum(amount) is used to generate total sales of each month. These metrics offer valuable insights into the business's performance over time.
